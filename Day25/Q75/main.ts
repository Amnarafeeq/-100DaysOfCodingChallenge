// Compound Assignment Operators: Use compound assignment operators to simplify arithmetic operations. Start
//  with x = 4 and perform a series of operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division) on x using
//   compound operators.

function compoundAssignmentOperator(){
    let x = 4;
    console.log(x);
  // Addition  
    x += 2;
    console.log(x);
  // Subtraction  
    x -= 1;
    console.log(x);
  // Division
    x /= 10;  
    console.log(x);
  // Multiplication 
    x *= 20;
    console.log(x);
